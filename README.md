# GitPeek
GitPeek is a mini React application that allows users to search and view GitHub profiles of their friends, colleagues, or favorite developers â€” just by entering their username. It fetches real-time data from the GitHub API and displays it in a clean, responsive card layout. Perfect for quick lookups and profile sharing.
